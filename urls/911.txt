Under Professor Tawfik’s supervision, students in this course will provide triage services for EPICentre start-ups, which will include information and coaching relating on aspects of business law and intellectual property law (patents, copyright, trademarks, industrial designs, trade secrets). Law students will benefit from real-world experience working with a start-up clientele and helping them with their IP strategy. This service will not provide legal advice but will help start-ups identify their IP and business-related legal issues and will offer them guidance to ensure that their legal needs are addressed. EPIC members will be able to access the service for free.
