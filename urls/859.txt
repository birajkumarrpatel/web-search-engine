Welcome to UWill Discover 2018! Encouraging Student Discovery in Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity! About the Event Download the 2018 Conference Program Thank you to the undergraduate students who presented their research, scholarship, and creativity at the 2018 UWill Discover Conference! The 2018 conference included a record 100+ University of Windsor undergraduate student presentations, art installations, performances, and film productions over two days (March 22 and 23, 2018). The conference was an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students to highlight and showcase their discoveries and original work in their field of study, recognizing that discovery can take many forms and varies from field to field – research, business pitches, prototypes, film production, music and drama performance, compositions, educational tools, scholarship, etc. UWill Discover 2018 brought together students, faculty and staff across all university faculties and programs, along with regional business and community partners. UWill Discover was generously sponsored in part by: Thank you to EPICentre, for being the official sponsor of the 2018 UWill Discover Closing Reception and Awards Ceremony.

The University of Windsor has recast its strategic research priorities into four Grand Challenges: (1) Healthy Great Lakes; (2) Viable, Healthy and Safe Communities; (3) Sustainable Industry; and (4) Understanding Borders. These Grand Challenges are based on our geographical location and our historic research strengths. They collectively define us and tell the external world our aspirations and goals. No other Canadian university can tackle these challenges simultaneously today.
