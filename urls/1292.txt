The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation. A brand’s visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements. The best brand identity systems are executed with consistency and adherence to graphic standards like those described on this website. Please take the time to read and properly implement our graphic standards. This discipline is fundamental to the success of our identity program. We encourage you to strive for quality and consistency to ensure the University of Windsor brand is experienced with clarity and integrity. share tweet save Today's Events Final oral defense\: Nicolas Charlton (M.A.) 9:00am Marketing Your Skills through a Teaching Dossier 10:00am to 11:30am Final oral defense\: Hawa Osman (M.Ed.) 11:00am Upcoming Events Externship Program Showcase Wed, 04/01/2020 - 12:00 Bake Sale Wed, 04/01/2020 - 12:00 Indigenous Speaker Series with Ellen Gabriel Thu, 04/02/2020 MLAWs End of Year Dinner Thu, 04/02/2020 - 19:00 Last day of classes, except JD Law and Education Fri, 04/03/2020 more share tweet save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
