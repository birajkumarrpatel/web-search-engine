The office of Career Development & Experiential Learning brings you the opportunity to mentor and support service learning students that want to have a real impact on their community. Our service learning students have been vetted through a competitive admission process including an application, resume submission, interview and academic review. If you represent a non-profit or publicly funded organization, we would like to invite you to tap into our pool of motivated and talented students! Please note that there are no fees or costs associated with your participation. VIP-CSL participants work with local community partners to have an impact on their community while gaining skills and experience for their future careers. Service learners will apply discipline specific knowledge while addressing community need. In addition to volunteering a minimum of 40 hours, students will also complete a series of short professional development activities both online and in-person. This opportunity will take place during a single semester and is co-curricular (in addition to their academic courses). Our staff will match off-campus non-profit organizations will volunteers in positions that relate to the students’ academic program as well as their skills and abilities. Students will work onsite or at community events to complete a minimum of 40 volunteer hours over one semester. Community service learning students are typically start volunteering in the second month of the academic term (October, February, June). Students come from a variety of programs (Arts & Social Sciences, Business, Science and Engineering, etc.), and are ready and willing to delve into task-based or project orientated roles that will provide an opportunity for them to apply discipline specific knowledge from their academic program. They can be assigned to a special project or be integrated into your day-to-day operations. We will invite postings for the Fall 2019 term July 15 – August 23. The deadline to submit a Fall position for approval is August 23, 2019. We have a new job posting form as of Fall 2018. Resources are available to help you write a competitive position, please ask Jane Sylvester if you need assistance at least one week in advance of the deadline.
