Not only is its success critical for the mental and physical health of its students, and the success of its varsity teams; but also for the very reputation of the school. For Windsor to attract future students, and to ensure that they have a complete educational experience this project simply must get done.” ~ Dr. Richard Peddie (BComm, ’70, Former President & CEO, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment). “The new Human Kinetics expansion will not only elevate the profile of the University in our community, drawing all ages to participate in a wide range of activities, but it will showcase the University for visitors and prospective students, making the University of Windsor a desired destination for post-secondary and graduate studies. The new facility has the potential to draw more provincial, national and international events and serves to promote Windsor as a University of Excellence. ~ Andrea Steen, MD, (BHK ’79, DPN ’82), Former Olympian; Vice-President, Medical Affairs, Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital. “The importance of this project cannot be underestimated in terms of moving forward in concert with other enhancements of the University. The St. Denis Centre has and will continue to be a student hub of the campus and a venue to provide opportunities in sport, recreation and academic achievement.” ~ Dennis Hastings (BHK ’75, B.Ed ’76), Director, St. Denis Centre 1985-95; Executive Director, Facility Services (retired). “I know this new facility will enhance the student experience for all students as well as our athletes. I feel this project is my chance to "pay it forward" and say "thank you" to the University of Windsor for giving me my working career in education. ~ Jean Wright (BA ’71, BEd ’72), President, University of Windsor Alumni Association Board of Directors. “As an alumnus, class of ’81, when I look back on our decision to support the building of the existing St. Denis Centre I take pride in what we voted for and what was accomplished. The next step in upgrading the existing facility is something that you should all take pride in. Think ahead and someday in the future you can proudly boast that you were instrumental in having a hand in the new upgraded facilities at the University of Windsor. I do that every time I walk into the existing St. Denis Centre.” ~ Sam Romano (B.Comm ’81), Senior Manager Commercial Cards, RBC Financial Group. “The Lancer Sport and Recreation Centre will enhance the university’s reputation and student experience by promoting student-athlete ambitions, an active lifestyle approach to well-being and a sense of community among students, faculty, staff, and the Windsor-Essex region.” ~ Dr. Michael Khan, Dean, Faculty of Human Kinetics.
