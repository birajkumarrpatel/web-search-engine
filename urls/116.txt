Collective bargaining processes and agreements must reflect UWindsor’s overall strategic goals, which include being a place that values the contributions that all employees make to our University’s mission. In this climate of fiscal constraint, we look forward to bargaining respectfully and responsibly, and with the principles of fairness and sustainability, while maintaining flexibility. This website will provide timely updates regarding the ongoing collective bargaining process with employee groups across the campus, as well as information about government policies that affect the public sector as it bargains with its employees’ bargaining agents.
