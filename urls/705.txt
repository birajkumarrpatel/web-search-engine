Sue Skrobiak left us many treasured memories, strong reasons for celebration and a call to action. Rather than dwell on our deep sadness, we wish to honour and continue Sue’s rich legacy of service by recognizing those who best reflect her work. As the centrepiece of the celebration, we announce the new Sue Skrobiak Award for Excellence. The Skrobiak Award will be presented annually to a recipient who has positively impacted the Odette School of Business MBA Program for a sustained period. Award recipients can take a number of forms— an alumnus of the program, a past Odette faculty or staff member, or an engaged individual or organization. The Sue Skrobiak Award for Excellence will be bestowed in a special way as well, at the Odette Dean’s Dinner, the culmination of the fall MBA Orientation and an event that Sue cherished. Those at the heart of Sue’s attention, our students, have also not been forgotten. An annual bursary will be given to a deserving MBA student in honour of the Sue Skrobiak Award for Excellence recipient. The recognized student, like Sue, will be that rare individual who combines leading performance with an abiding commitment to the Odette M.B.A. and to the broad group of people it touches. How can you help? The staff and faculty of the Odette School of Business are developing a fund, the Sue Skrobiak Award for Excellence Endowment, in her memory. Our goal is to establish an endowed award to ensure that the Sue Skrobiak Award for Excellence is a permanent and fitting reminder of her esteemed legacy. Donations generously given beyond the target will be directed to other worthy causes related to the Odette M.B.A. Program and its students. For example, priority will be given to the refurbishment of the Odette MBA student lounge. This space will then be renamed in honour of Sue, in a ceremony to take place upon the work’s completion. Any additional funds will be directed thereafter to appropriate activities and projects like MBA case competitions, MBA leadership forums, and updates to the main MBA classroom within the Odette School of Business. I invite you now to make a gift in honour of Sue. Please assist us in commemorating and continuing the work she loved and so many appreciated. Simply choose one of the three options listed, and remember that your support is the key to an enduring celebration. Sincerely, Dr. Mitchell W. Fields, Dean, Odette School of Business Please ensure that online donations are clearly intended for the Sue Skrobiak Endowment Fund. Similarly, make cheques payable to the University of Windsor while referencing the Sue Skrobiak Endowment Fund on the memo line. U.S. residents who donate to the Odette School of Business can receive a U.S. Tax receipt. Please make your donation payable to our U.S. Foundation, “Friends of the University of Windsor.” Again, clearly, state that your monies are intended for the Sue Skrobiak Endowment Fund.
