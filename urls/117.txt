Cuts to Ontario’s provincial travel coverage The Ontario government recently confirmed that the Ontario Health Insurance Plan’s (OHIP’s) limited coverage of emergency out-of-country medical costs will end effective January 1, 2020. Currently OHIP covers out-of-country inpatient services to a maximum of $400 per day for a higher level of care, such as intensive care, and up to $50 per day for emergency outpatient care and physician services. With the elimination of this coverage, the Ontario Renal Network within Cancer Care Ontario will be administering a program to help Ontario renal dialysis patients with financial aid for dialysis services when travelling abroad as of January 1. OHIP will continue to reimburse eligible emergency out-of-country claims incurred up to and including December 31, 2019. The timeframe to submit eligible claims has not changed and is still 12 months from the date of service. Therefore, eligible claims can be submitted up to December 31, 2020. Note that this change will not impact the coverage provided under GSC’s travel plans – Plan members will not see any difference in their benefits or our claims adjudication process for out-of-country emergency medical claims. Updated booklet wording will be incorporated at the next reprint/repost after January 1, but wording modifications will be minimal. NEW - October 1, 2017 - GSC recently updated the definition of "stable" so that it is more detailed and specific. This new definition is shown in your benefits booklet.
