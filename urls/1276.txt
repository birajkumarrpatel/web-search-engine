He was appointed interim President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Windsor from July 2018 to September 2019. From 2010 to 2015 he was Dean of the Faculty of Humanities at Brock University and before that he served as Professor and Chair of the Department of English at Western University. After completing his BA and MA at Western and his PhD at the University of Toronto, he held a SSHRC postdoctoral fellowship at Yale University and a Folger Shakespeare Library fellowship in Washington, DC before joining Western’s Department of English, where he taught for twenty-five years, serving as national president of the Canadian Association of Chairs of English, and receiving the Edward G.

He has also taught at Yale, the University of Toronto, Bishop’s University, University College Northampton, and Queen’s University’s International Study Centre at Herstmonceux, and attended the School of Criticism and Theory at Dartmouth College. He has held SSHRC Standard Research and Occasional Scholarly Conference grants, and has served widely as an external appraiser for academic review, promotion and tenure, and manuscript assessments. As Dean of the Faculty of Humanities at Brock University, he oversaw the building of a 95,000 square-foot downtown facility in collaboration with the City of St Catharines to support Brock’s programs in the fine and performing arts. He served on the Board of Directors for the Niagara Interactive Media Generator and for the cross-border 1812 Legacy Council. He was a member of the Rodman Hall Art Centre Advisory Board and the St Catharines Downtown Development and Revitalization Committee, and served on back-to-back negotiations for Brock University on collective agreements with the Faculty Association. He also oversaw the implementation of Brock’s first binational MA in Canadian-American Studies with the University at Buffalo.
