It is a growing and challenging profession committed to the improvement of the quality of life for individuals, families, communities and society. Mission Statement The mission of the School of Social Work is to promote social justice through quality professional education, advocacy, community partnerships, and the development and dissemination of knowledge through enquiry. Vision The School’s commitment of social justice and its mandate in social work education finds its roots in the profession’s historical commitment to serve the interests of oppressed and vulnerable populations and a set of fundamental values stated in the profession’s Code of Ethics. This mandate is realized in the preparation of students with knowledge, research and practice intervention skills to assume professional and leadership roles to eradicate systemic barriers which oppress persons and disenfranchised populations. Principles of justice find their meaning here in a fundamental belief in the dignity of all persons, the importance of access of citizens to participate, and striving for a more equitable distribution of our society’s resources in the interest of promoting quality of life for all citizens. To that end, the School aims to: Ensure graduates are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and dedication to make a critical contribution on a local, provincial, national, and global scale to enhance the well-being of all citizens. Advance research, practice and policy through student participation and engagement in the unique, diverse, and interdisciplinary and combined programs offered at the University and School of Social Work. Collaborate with our diverse partners to address social inequities at local, provincial, national and global levels while recognizing the school’s unique geographic location on an international border creates research and leadership opportunities within a broad North American context.
