About GLIER (Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research) The Environmental Science program is offered through GLIER and is the only graduate program in North America that focuses explicitly on stressors in large aquatic systems and their watersheds, such as the Great Lakes. Our program is focused, well funded, high-impact, and has a growing international reputation for excellence in our chosen field of research. With the cumulative impacts of human-induced change steadily increasing, research in the environmental field is becoming even more important. With plentiful funding in recent years, researchers at GLIER study the effects of environmental stressors on large watersheds, using the institute’s 19 fully equipped laboratories, many meeting rooms, and its private launch along the Detroit River for its research boats. At GLIER, our ultimate goal is training the environmental stewards of the future. In our tri-level facility, we house lab and equipment for aquatic research, advanced microscopy and materials characterization and environmental genomics.
