The program will enable ambitious students at the Odette School of Business to help local charities with capacity building. Along with support from student teams, charities will also receive support from experts and mentors to identify and work on strategic solutions to their most pressing needs. We will coordinate this outreach with existing EPIC programs and community partners supporting social innovation on and off campus with a course curriculum designed to teach students about social and environmental impact. Programming includes a social innovation workshop, impact investing, case studies about local social enterprises, and social finance. The aim of this program is to support local charities working to make positive social impact in our community and introduce to students the benefits of collaboration and community within the charity sector in Windsor-Essex. Charities participating in the initiative will receive a stipend of up to $7000 for participation. This represents $50/hour for 5 hours a week over 28 weeks.
