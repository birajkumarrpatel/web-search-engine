We are making efforts to ensure that we maintain contact with former students from the time they cross the stage through to the next phases in life. We recognize that we have not done a good enough job to this point. We will be committing time and resources to tell your success stories. We would like to cultivate a cyclical relationship with our past, present and future, students, faculty and staff. Stay posted to this website and our social media feeds to find out how we are trying to engage with you.
