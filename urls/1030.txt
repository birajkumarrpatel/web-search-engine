DOWNLOAD REFERRAL SHEET Sexual Assault Statement from the Interim President To all members of the University of Windsor community: The University of Windsor takes very seriously the safety and well-being of students, faculty, staff, and other members of our campus community. We strive to be a place where people are able to study, work, engage, and grow personally, socially, and intellectually without fear of violence, coercion, or harassment of any kind. On this website you will find information about the policies, procedures, and in particular the supports surrounding sexual assault and sexual misconduct. If you or someone you know has experienced sexual misconduct, please make full use of the links and information provided here for assistance. While offering support for individuals who have experienced sexual assault or sexual misconduct, the University of Windsor is also being proactive in emphasizing prevention and education. Programs such as the Bystander Initiative, Flip the Script, and Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act (EAAA) Sexual Assault Resistance seek to reduce the incidence of sexual misconduct and foster a culture of both respect and responsibility for one another. As members of a community that since 1857 has come together to study, to learn, to teach, and to serve, we all have a human investment in caring for one another and in making our University a safe, welcoming, and positive place. The resources on this website are one part of that investment.
