They can be used to facilitate discussion and provide guidance for departments who are developing or revising their criteria. You are welcome to use them, revise them, or delete or add elements as you see fit to accurately and fairly reflect the nature of high-quality teaching within your area. Regardless of how (or whether) you use the template, ultimately all RTP criteria documents should provide: clear, well organized criteria, illustrative elements of the practices included in each criterion, an explanation of the evidence that can be used to demonstrate that an individual has met a criterion (generally from multiple sources), and a description of the standard at which individuals must meet the established criteria for tenure and specific levels of promotion. Why use the Framework approach? To help: clarify standards and process for new and progressing faculty members offer faculty members the best possible chance to make their case for promotion or tenure based on their unique situation, strengths, principles and practices establish decision-making processes that are clear, systematic, as consistent as possible, and also flexible enough to reflect the diversity of practice within disciplines create departmental RPT documents that reflect the level of sophistication of committee discussion ensure that departmental standards are clear to UCAPT, external referees, and, should it be necessary, to external arbitrators communicate and value the effort, thought, commitment and skill that faculty bring to their scholarly responsibilities Criteria Overview Teaching Evaluation Framework Word Version Research Evaluation Framework Word Version Service Evaluation Framework Word Version Strategies for Adapting the Framework Example Summary Document: Criteria and Indicators Only Exemplars: UCAPT-Approved Criteria Communication, Media and Film (approved January 21, 2020) Computer Science (approved June 12, 2019 – some minor editorial changes forthcoming) Dramatic Art – AAS RTP criteria (approved June 12, 2019) History (approved June 15, 2018) Law (approved in March 4, 2019 -- some minor editorial changes forthcoming) Political Science (approved January 21, 2020) Standards Strategies for Developing Summary Departmental Standards Sample Research Evaluation Rubric Word Version Sample Teaching Evaluation Rubric Sample Single-Level Summary Standard (Teaching) Word Version Sample Multiple-Level Summary Standard (Research) Word Version Sample Multiple-Level Summary Standard (Teaching) (legal size document) Word Version Other Working Documents Blank Teaching Evaluation Rubric Blank Single-Level Summary Standard (Teaching) Blank Multiple-Level Summary Standard (Teaching) Teaching Evaluation Framework Working Document Blank Research Criteria Framework Blank Research Criteria Rubric Research Criteria Working Document Explanatory note regarding adapting materials We are very happy to work with committees and departments to explore how these materials can be adapted to your needs.
