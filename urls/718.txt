Ph.D. in Kinesiology The foundation of our Ph.D. program in Kinesiology is a community-based focus recognized as ensuring the well-being of both individuals and the collective at the local, national, and international levels. Graduates will be prepared to provide the resources necessary to sustain the community and will be able to supply current, novel ideas, and knowledge. This community-based focus in a Kinesiology program is not represented in any other existing program in Canada. Students will be required to complete four courses, one of which is a community-based internship. The internship will encourage the integration of our students into ongoing community initiatives, enhance responsibility for meeting the needs of others while improving the overall well-being of Canadians, and encourage students to utilize previously acquired skills while gaining new skills, appropriate to their internship setting. The targeted steady-state student enrolment for the PhD Program in Kinesiology is sixteen doctoral students.
