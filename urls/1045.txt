We can assist you with general support regarding how to read your Academic Progess Report, course registration, changing majors and introducing you to the University of Windsor's policies and procedures. Coming to a new institution can be challenging and it is essential to your academic success that you utilize our campus student support services. I encourage you to meet with an Academic Advisor every semester to ensure that you are on the right track, utilize professor’s office hours, and get involved on campus through Lead@Uwindsor or by joining a club! When you have some free time, be sure to explore Windsor-Essex County and all it has to offer, or hop across our boarder to explore Detroit, Michigan! Star-gaze at Point Pelee National Park, enjoy some Italian food on Erie street, explore our biking and hiking trails, attend a concert at Casino Windsor or Little Caesars Arena, purchase tickets to a Detroit Tigers game, and explore world-class galleries and museums! Throughout your undergraduate experience, if you have any questions, feel free to stop by the Advising Office. We are located in Dillon Hall, room 111 (lower level).
