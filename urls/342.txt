Areas of Specialization Curriculum studies Educational administration Second Language Acquisition, Culture and Society (SLACS) M.Ed International Cohort This course-based program will enable you to examine philosophical orientations, conceptual frameworks, and research methodologies relevant to the study of Canadian Education. The program objectives will be accomplished through the completion of nine courses followed by the capstone course, the Research Internship. A distinguishing feature of the International Cohort M. Ed. is the Educational Research Internship. The Internship will take place in collaboration with school board, college, university, and selected community organization leaders. It presents students with authentic assessment tasks that situates their on-going inquiries in a context that enables them to apply and further critique what has been learned previously. Individually or as part of a two or three person research team, students will engage in matters pertaining to research, program review, policy development, and so on, as appropriate. The spectrum of projects may, for example, address questions aimed at the improvement of literacy and numeracy skills, student motivation, curriculum integration, and leadership development.
