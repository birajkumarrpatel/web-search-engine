About the Conference Download the 2019 Conference Program UWill Discover is a campus wide conference that showcases research, ideas, inventions and creative activity from every department and faculty on campus! It is excellent opportunity for students to share their work in an interdisciplinary context with faculty and their peers. There are also great opportunities for students to get involved in organizing the conference. UWill Discover draws attention to and celebrates our students’ research and original creative activity. It is an expression of the goals and aspirations of our University, to develop deeper and broader connections between teaching and research, between learning and the community, and between the classroom, the lab, and the working world. 2019 Awards Congratulations to the following student award winners People's Choice Award - Sponsored by the University of Windsor Alumni Association Determining the Essentiality of Spy-1 as a Novel Regulator of Mammary Cell Development Using CRISPR/Cas9 by Catalin M.

Qaqish Grand Challenges Information When submitting your project proposal, you need to specify which one of the 4 grand challenges fits most closely with your work. If you have any questions about what grand challenge may fit your work most closely, please contact the UWill Discover Organizing Committee (uwilldiscover@uwindsor.ca) with "Grand Challenges" as the subject line. The University of Windsor has recast its strategic research priorities into four Grand Challenges: (1) Healthy Great Lakes; (2) Viable, Healthy and Safe Communities; (3) Sustainable Industry; and (4) Understanding Borders. These Grand Challenges are based on our geographical location and our historic research strengths. They collectively define us and tell the external world our aspirations and goals. No other Canadian university can tackle these challenges simultaneously today. Notice that each category crosses discipline boundaries and is inherently interdisciplinary. Please refer to the descriptions below about each grand challenge and determine which one your work fits best under. Healthy Great Lakes: Projects that advance and communicate fundamental knowledge of Great Lakes science; develop technologies that improve water quality and biota health; contribute to a culture that values and prioritizes activities that enhance the health of the Great Lakes; understand and help develop the policies and regulations to safeguard the Great Lakes; mitigate and adapt to the effects of natural and societal impact to the Great Lakes and lead remediation efforts in the Great Lakes region and beyond; and train highly qualified personnel who will become next-generation scholars and leaders. Viable, Healthy and Safe Communities: Explore and understand the social, economic and health conditions that will lead to viable, healthy and safe communities; advance knowledge about the lives of designated groups and diverse people , including First Nations, women, ethnic and sexual minorities, the disabled, recent immigrants and others, not only of problems, but also of strengths and resiliencies to maximize the health of people and the vibrancy of communities; advance the humanities, arts, social and natural sciences, technologies and engineering that will enhance the viability, health, livability and safety of communities; build synergy from various stakeholders and sectors that will enhance the above goals; and train highly qualified personnel who will become next-generation social and technological entrepreneurs, scholars and leaders. Sustainable Industry: Collaborate with multi-sector industrial stakeholders to help build sustainable industries; mobilize knowledge and technologies to collaborating industry partners; accommodate and facilitate the collaboration with participating industrial partners who prefer locating their innovation units at the University to develop next-generation ideas and products; provide business, legal and technical advice to industries on a collaborative basis; and train highly qualified personnel who will become next-generation industrial entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and engineers. Understanding Borders Understand all issues, including logistical, economical, societal, human, cultural, political, legal and trade, associated with borders and border-crossing; understand and support the development of policies, regulations and best practices that will facilitate border crossing; develop the science, technology and engineering that will facilitate safe and secure border crossings, including that of knowledge, goods, certifications, regulations and people; train highly qualified personnel who will become next-generation scholars and leaders; and understand and support bi-national coordination of environmental and emergency management in border regions.
