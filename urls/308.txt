Nursing Our program combines equal doses of hands-on learning and academic excellence. Clinical practicum courses start in year one with a 1:8 instructor-student ratio and take place in a variety of healthcare settings throughout the first three years of the program. In fact, the Faculty of Nursing is partnered with more than 250 hospital and community agencies throughout southwestern Ontario. In the final year of their program, students gain independence as they work alongside a preceptor (1:1 ratio), completing a total of 384 hours in both hospital and community settings. To reinforce student learning in both the classroom and in clinical settings, we have a series of seven experiential learning labs taught throughout the program. These labs are specifically designed to help the learner apply theory to clinical practice through a variety of interactive and simulated activities. In order to dynamically support student learning, nursing students have access to academic and career advising through the Student Success Coordinator and free counseling services through the Clinical Therapist embedded in the program. After graduation, students write the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) to be eligible for membership with the College of Nurses of Ontario. In 2018, 95.8% passed the NCLEX by the end of the year in which they graduated. This is because students receive outstanding instruction from award-winning professors who are dedicated to student success. At an undergraduate level, students are engaged in professional development activities stemming from current research initiatives and best practices in Nursing. The NCLEX is the same exam that American students write. Graduates from the program may choose to pursue employment opportunities in the United States and would not need to write an alternate exam. Other eligibility criteria may be requested and may differ by state.
