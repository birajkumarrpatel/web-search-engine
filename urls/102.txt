It appears on the front of the "@" sign in your University of Windsor's primary e-mail address (userid@uwindsor.ca) and it is being used as login name for most University computer systems. Some systems however, such as Office 365, require entire primary e-mail address to be entered as login name (i.e. userid@uwindsor.ca).

These circumstances fall under the following categories: Legal name changes - before your UWin ID will be changed your name changes must be made in the appropriate systems of record (either the Student Information System or Human Resources).
