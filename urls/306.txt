I spent my third year living in Spain, studying at the Universidad de Valladolid, and travelling Europe – truly an amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience. While abroad, I also tutored two native Spanish girls in English. Between the tutoring abroad and the teaching practicum I took in my fourth year, I was able to reaffi rm that teaching is my career path."
