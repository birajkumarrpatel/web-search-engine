Undergrads across campus were invited to submit a question that they were curious about. From those submissions the best 30 were selected to participate in a campus wide vote. The top 30 research questions can be viewed below! Thank you to everyone who participated. We had a lot of excellent questions, and some tough decisions to make. Voting is Now Compete and we have our Winners! Prizes were awarded in three categories: the question receiving the most votes, one randomly selected question, and one randomly selected voter.
