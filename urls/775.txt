The Secretariat is in the midst of developing a new CORE tutorial that will incorporate many of the changes found in the new Policy. A summary of the revisions that were published in TCPS (2018) is available in the Highlights of Changes. However, there were no fundamental changes to the Policy. The three core principles – Respect for Persons, Concern for Welfare, and Justice – continue to be the foundation of both the new Policy and CORE. During this transition phase, users are encouraged to continue accessing the current CORE. It is important to note that links to the former version of the Policy have been disabled. The Policy revision has resulted in changes that are not yet reflected in the following areas of the tutorial: Module 2 – Defining Research Review requirements for course-based research activities with a pedagogical purpose (Articles 2.1 and 6.12). Definition of pilot study and a description of REB requirements for pilot studies (Articles 2.1 and 6.11). Description of different types of observational research (Article 2.3) Module 3 – Assessing Risk and Benefit Research-Attributable Risk (Article 2.10) Research Involving Communities (Article 2.11) Module 6 – Fairness and Equity Dissemination of Research Results (Article 4.8) Module 7 – Conflict of interest Institutional responsibilities regarding financial conflict of interest (Article 7.4) Module 8 – REB Review Review requirements for course-based research activities with a pedagogical purpose (Articles 2.1 and 6.12).
