A program attentive to developing the craft of historical research, writing and analysis, the graduate program prepares students equally for continuing with academic studies at the doctoral level and for a variety of other careers where the knowledge and skills of the historian are valued. The Master of Arts in History program is a small program, providing a supportive atmosphere for our students, who have achieved many successes such as winning provincial and national scholarships; acceptance of revised versions of major papers in scholarly journals and parts of major papers published in e-journals; as well as presenting at various lecture series and conferences. Many of our graduates have also had success outside the academic world as lawyers, librarians, museum curators, financial advisors, civil servants and even as employees of this university.
