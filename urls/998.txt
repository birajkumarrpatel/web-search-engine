Academic integrity is more than just plagiarism and cheating. It means centering your academic journey around the core values of honesty, respect, fairness, and responsibility. At the University of Windsor, we expect our students, faculty, and staff to contribute to a positive environment where academic integrity is upheld in all of our work. What We Do The Student Support Office advocates for academic integrity through honesty, education, and enforcement. We aim to create a positive learning environment where individuals learn from the resources and ideas of others while generating their own thoughts and conclusions. Our office adopts a neutral administrative role when academic misconduct is alleged to have occurred. We ensure that all members involved understand their rights and responsibilities under the Senate Bylaw 31: Academic Integrity and the Student Code of Conduct. share tweet save share tweet save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
