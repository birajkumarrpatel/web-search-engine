Now in its second year, the stand-alone course addresses regulatory and legal challenges in professional and intercollegiate sports, placing an emphasis on commercial issues. “The professional sports industry is valued at more than $73 billion,” says Senthe. “This class uses innovative pedagogical tools and collaborative networks to enhance the learning experience.” In an effort to share her passion with like-minded law students, Senthe has designed a lecture series as a component of the course curriculum. “The goal is to create a dynamic learning space for students by hosting guest speakers throughout the year, such as high-profile athletes, lawyers, legal academics, agents, physicians, and journalists from Canada and the United States,” she says. The Sports Law Lecture Series will open Wednesday, Sept. 25, with a presentation by Detroit Tigers representatives Alan Avila, associate counsel, and Sam Menzin, director of baseball operations, at the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law. For a few Windsor Law students, the course is something they can undoubtedly relate to. First-year student Chris Osei-Kusi joined the Lancer football team on the field this month, while first-year Laura DeMarco and second-year Jamie Oleksiew, both of the Dual JD program, gear up to play for the Lancers women’s golf team this season.
