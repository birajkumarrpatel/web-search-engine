Our faculty use their knowledge and expertise across a broad range of disciplines to work with our students and members of our communities—regional, national and international—to create opportunities for success and collaboration. Through the Place of Promise Campaign, the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences aims to create the best possible future for our students and communities. Investments in our strategic funding opportunities, will advance our innovative research and creative activity, enrich the student experience and allow us to continue to grow our expanding programs. Thank you for joining us in our vision. Our Priorities Downtown Campus Moving downtown is key to strengthening our university and our connection to the community. Beyond the historic preservation, new buildings and purpose-built space, our many innovative projects in development will impact both our students and the community. Writer-in-Residence The study and writing of literature is key to understanding the diversity and complexity of ourselves and society. Expanding our Writer in Residence initiative would provide enhanced opportunities for experiential learning, production of original work, development of creative culture and the strengthening of university and community partnerships. Young Achievers We will work with our community partners and educators to identify students from under-represented communities who would be unlikely to attend university but are likely to succeed. Our vision is to offer orientation and support for both students and families to remove barriers from attending and being successful at university.
