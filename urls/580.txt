For details, see the Notice of Disclosure Confidentiality and Use of Personal Information (FIPPA). A student may assign a delegate to access to their UWinsite Student account. Only the student and individuals listed as delegates will be authorized to discuss particulars of the student account. For instructions on how to add a delegate, review this ask.UWindsor article. Third Party Sponsors The University defines a sponsor as a third party organization or group that is covering some or all of the costs of a student's fees. This includes (but is not limited to) Native Groups, Government Embassies, WSIB Claimants or Employers of students. If you are interested in sponsoring a student, please read the Sponsor Introduction Letter. As a student, you can find information regarding your sponsor in the Student Introduction Letter. A Sponsor Approval Request Form and Authorization to Invoice Form are required for each student. Please send sponsor inquiries to sponsor@uwindsor.ca. Tuition Information You can view tuition information online using the UWinsite Student. Scholarships, bursaries, residence and meal plan charges appear on your account in early August for Fall semester and early December for Winter semester. Statements are emailed in early August for Fall semester and early December for Winter semester. If you require a hard copy statement (required if paying at a bank) email cashiers@uwindsor.ca and one will be sent to the address on file in UWinsite Student. If you are paying by cheque/bank draft/money order, ensure your Student ID is clearly marked to ensure credit to the proper account. Allow time for mailing to ensure your payment arrives before the deadline. Auditing Courses A student who audits a course(s) is one who attends a course(s), but, does not receive credit for the course(s) towards their degree. Such a student will not be eligible to write examinations and may not be graded but, will be required to pay the stated fee(s) for the course(s). Contact us if you have questions about fees, payments, or financial policies. Mission & Vision The Student Accounts office is a unit within the Budgets and Financial Services department responsible for responding to student inquiries on the payment of fees in a timely and efficient manner. We ensure all students are informed on their account related services while adhering to confidentiality policies and regulations. Confidentiality To preserve the confidentiality of financial records, staff are required to maintain a strict confidentiality policy regarding student's accounts. Staff cannot allow anybody but the student to access information from their accounts without the authorization of the student. This includes receipts, statements or discussion of financial records. Failure to obey this policy may result in disciplinary action against the staff member. University Bylaws prohibit the release of a Student ID to anyone but the student. If you do not know the ID of a student, contact them directly to obtain it. We recognize parents often pay students accounts, thus, the Cashiers Office created a process to allow students to authorize us to speak to any individuals they wish to discuss their financial accounts with. The authorization form is available on UWinsite Student under the Self Service - Delegated Access. Authorization is limited to the financial record, granted annually, and can be canceled anytime. Income Tax Forms for Students Students may access their T2202 forms through their UWinsite Student account. T4A slips are available on UWinsite Student so log in and provide consent to receive your T4A under Account Services - Income Tax Form. Summer Programs The following are summer programs. If you are enrolled in a minimum of 4 courses, you will be deemed full-time for the Summer and charged accordingly.

Students taking part-time courses will pay $1860 CAD/course. Incidental fees, residence and meal plan charges are not included and are charged in CDN dollars. Entrance Awards, Scholarships, and Bursaries If you receive entrance awards, scholarships, and bursaries, they are applied 50% in the Fall and 50% in the Winter, except for Entrance Bursaries, which are applied 100% in the Fall. These awards should appear on your account in early to mid-August. If they do not appear when you are ready to pay but know you are eligible for them, deduct that amount from your fees owing. If you already paid and have been awarded scholarships, awards or bursaries and your account has a negative balance, you qualify for a refund. A refund cheque must be requested through UWinsite Student. The refund may be requested any time, however, the refund will be generated ASAP (end of Sept for Fall and end of Feb for Winter).
