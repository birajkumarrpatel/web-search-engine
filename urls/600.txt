For the most part, this is not because they are not valuable initiatives, but rather it is mostly attributed to flawed execution, failure to understand what the change is about, failure to realize the extent of the organizational change and a disconnect between the strategic aspect of the change and the tactical elements that include the project itself, the team involved and the measurement of success. This program connects change management and project management in a unique manner at 4 different levels: Introduction of change management practical concepts Review of leadership attributes for effectively leading change initiatives Establish a connection between the change initiative and project management by ensuring project managers fully understand the impact their projects’ products and results will have on the organization Provide project managers with relevant concepts to effectively lead their project within the changing environment This program helps integrate projects, their context, and the reasons why are they taking place. While it does not cover business analysis elements related to building a business case, it covers the strategic context and the vision that are behind the need for the project. Further, the program helps participants build a solid thread of reasoning, rationale, and continuity and it enables project managers and business leaders to make informed decisions. After taking this program, participants will be positioned to effectively lead projects in a way that meets the actual needs for which the project was undertaken and it helps project managers better understand change management concepts and allows business leaders to understand the applicable project management and change management touchpoints. In turn, this will lead to a greater success with the alignment between the organizational change initiative and the tactical elements that ensue in the form of project management, with focus on both “traditional” project considerations, as well as organizational change in the context of agile. By the end of the session, participants will be able to: Identify realities, challenges and barriers related to change Make a connection between project management and the change it introduces to the organization Develop the capacity to lead different types of change (e.g., strategic plans, lifecycle changes, market, leadership, process, restructuring, M&A, outsourcing) Engage in appropriate leadership styles in the project and across organizational boundaries and learn to lead from anywhere in the organization Align project elements (including people, processes and structures)with organizational strategy and needs Balance planning with execution Build commitment and consensus and handle resistance Foster sustainable change capacity within the organization by connecting the change initiative to the project and the tactical aspect of the change Develop and communicate a compelling vision and strategy and create a tangible benefit measurement plan The course is designed for: Project managers, senior project managers, project sponsors, managers of project managers and organizational leaders who are project stakeholders and work in any capacity. It is also designed for business directors and vice-presidents, public sector directors and program managers, human resources managers, operations managers, and team leads. Prerequisites: There are no prerequisites for this course. Materials: Participants will receive a course binder containing copies of presentation slides, case studies, and exercises.

How can you plan when the things keep changing? Traditional project management approaches suggest that we take a snapshot of the requirements as a baseline, and then use change control in an attempt to minimize the impact of any shifting requirements. Sometimes, however, these changes are a reality that the project sponsor has to accommodate. The new agile project management methods help deal with these situations. Participants in this 3-day session will learn the techniques of disciplined, structured agile project management through simulations and examples from real-world projects that used these methods to control changing requirements. This course is designed to meet the educational requirements for three certification exams: the PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP), the Scrum Master Certification (SMC). and the Certified Agile Project Manager (Cert.APM) exams. To provide experienced project managers with advanced understanding of: the principles and techniques of disciplined, structured agile project management (including agile estimating and planning, agile metrics and forecasting, and agile quality management) how to identify situations where agile techniques may add value how to begin applying the techniques to reduce overall project risk on high change projects. Who Should Attend: The Agile Project Management course introduces some advanced variations on basic project management practices. While anyone can attend, project managers with some experience managing IT projects or new product development projects will find the material more applicable to their day-to-day work. Prerequisites: Although there is no formal pre-requisite for this course, it is assumed that participants already have some training or experience in project management. This couse does not teach the fundamentals of project management; rather, it explains how agile practices are different from more conventional practices -- it does not teach the conventional practices. If applicants already have their CAPM, PMP or CPMA (IPMA Level-D), then they have more than demonstrated their basic understanding of project management and would be ready to take this course. For those with no prior project management knowledge or experience, Procept's 3-day Project Scheduling Essentials course (or equivalent) would provide suitable preparatory training. Materials: You will receive the course binder containing course handouts and presentations and a copy of Kevin Aguanno's best-selling book Managing Agile Projects.
