This week was comprised of panel discussions, workshops, seminars, and conferences – events of all kinds – to highlight trailblazing women entrepreneurs from all disciplines. Our focus at EPICentre was to highlight young women entrepreneurs that have participated in EPICentre programs and activities, as well as, recent graduates from the University of Windsor. As we see the world start to shift towards a more inclusive economy, we strongly believe that promoting these activities are pivotal to help strengthen the landscape of women in business, especially women entrepreneurs. We’d like to thank our panellists for taking the time to participate in this discussion that helps to promote #movingthedial forward.
