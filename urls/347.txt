You will need an advisor and will conduct research under your advisor’s supervision. This program is designed to be completed in two years. Scholarships and graduate assistantships are available by application. Continuation of your education is possible with this degree. MEng An MEng Degree may be awarded upon successful completion of a total of eight courses (the MEng has no research component/thesis/work with a faculty supervisor). Of these eight courses: Four courses must be from the student's department (major; materials) Plus four required courses to be taken in the first or second semester of the program: Computational Methods and Modeling for Engineering Applications; Engineering Technical Communications; Engineering Mathematics; and Engineering Project Management Co-op program is optional and students must apply for admission in their first study term. No funding or scholarships are available. Please also review the MEng website for a note regarding admissions PhD An applicant for admission to a course of graduate studies leading to the PhD degree in engineering must normally be a graduate of a recognized university with a research-based master's degree in engineering or applied science. Applicants with degrees in related fields will be considered but will normally require strengthening of their background in engineering. At the discretion of the Program Graduate Committee, Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) may be required. The Engineering Materials graduate program recognizes the close relationship between advanced level education and the advancement of knowledge, and is committed to excellence in graduate teaching and research. An emphasis on fundamental scientific research and strong research collaborations with industry characterize our programs. Research Research work carried out in the program can be classified under the general field of Materials Science and Engineering. This reflects the holistic approach that we have taken whereby we build upon a firm base of scientific research (materials science) and apply it to the development of new or improved materials and processes (materials engineering). Research is concentrated on the following aspects of materials: Physical Mechanical Tribological Chemical Processing Program Specific Admission Requirements Deadline for Fall: M.A.Sc., Ph.D: April 1 MEng: Please review the MEng website for admission availablity Deadline for Winter: M.A.Sc., Ph.D: August 1 MEng: Please review the MEng website for admission availablity Deadline for Summer: M.A.Sc., Ph.D: December 1 MEng: Please review the MEng website for admission availablity Minimum TOEFL: M.A.Sc., Ph.D.: IBT-83 MEng: IBT-92 Minimum IELTS: 6.5 Minimum Pearson: 65 Additional Requirements Resume/CV Research Interest The GRE is recommended for students graduating from Universities outside of North America.
