Publication ranks UWindsor MHK program top in Canada Jul 3rd, 2018 The Master of Human Kinetics, Sport Management major (MHK SM) has been ranked the best postgraduate sports business program in Canada and in the world’s top 25 by SportBusiness International. UWindsor’s offering ranked seventh among all non-U.S. schools and is the only Canadian school ranked by the U.K.-based trade publication. SportBusiness International used the class of 2015 as the benchmark to measure the programs. Graduate co-ordinator and sport management professor Jess Dixon credits the hard work and dedication of faculty, staff, and students in helping the program earn the recognition. “We have an outstanding group of faculty members who are supported by tremendous staff,” says Dixon. “Each member of our team aims to ensure the best possible academic experience for our students.” The efforts placed on student experience were not lost on the more than 1,300 survey respondents. UWindsor placed particularly high in student satisfaction, value of program, employment rate, and gender diversity. The MHK in Sport Management program allows students to complete their degree through internship or thesis pathways. Dr. Dixon says he often cites this flexibility as one of the hallmarks of the program. “Students have the option to pursue a practitioner-based education or a more traditional graduate pathway through the thesis route,” he says. “In each pathway, students are exposed to a diverse, research-based education that provides them with multiple lenses through which to examine the sports management landscape.” Milana McNamee, a graduate of the class of 2015, cites the MHK degree as the biggest stepping stone to her current role as athlete services retention co-ordinator in high performance athletics at Queen’s University. “The MHK program allowed me to research topics that sparked my interest, gain real-world experience, and make connections within the community,” McNamee says. As well, she worked as an intern with the 2014 Ontario Summer Games and held a position as sport operations manager with the FINA World Swimming Championship held in Windsor in 2015. Dean of Human Kinetics Michael Khan says he is pleased with his faculty’s impressive showing: “I am proud that our programs reflect the values of our faculty, staff and administration.” Visit https://www.uwindsor.ca/kinesiology/462/graduate-programs for more information on the award.
