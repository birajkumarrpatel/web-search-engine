You are here Home › About › Research & Scholarly Communication › Open Access Open Access (OA) scholarly literature is digital, online, free of charge, coupled with the right to use these works fully in the digital environment. Most research has until very recently been only available to the reader through subscriptions or affiliation with an institution that pays subscription fees. Open access changes this model providing greater access to research results, accelerating the progress of research, and ensures that publicly funded research is available to the public. Open access makes it possible for the results of research to have the greatest possible impact. Tri-Agency and Windsor Open Access Policy Info Beginning in the spring of 2015, Tri-council (SSRHC, NSERC, CIHR) grant recipients are required to ensure that any peer-reviewed journal publications arising from Agency-supported research are freely accessible within 12 months of publication.
