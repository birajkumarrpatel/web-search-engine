It is dedicated to assisting faculty, students, and other researchers in their exploration of southwestern Ontario history and culture. This region is one of the oldest settled areas in Ontario and has a rich history. This history encompasses settlement by Aboriginal groups, early French settlement led by Cadillac, the Jesuit mission to the Huron/Wyandotte Indians, Black fugitive settlement, and the vital role of the underground railway. In the later 19th and early 20th centuries, the region was a hub for industrial development and an important area for the study of management/labour relations in Canada.
