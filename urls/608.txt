Spring degrees will be awarded in absentia for those eligible students who have applied to graduate. Senate is expected to approve eligible candidates at its May 22, 2020 meeting. The Office of the Registrar will then begin to courier diplomas to graduates. In the coming months, once plans for the Fall Convocation ceremonies are finalized, the Office of the Registrar will reach out to invite Spring graduands and their families to participate in the Fall ceremonies. All graduating students will have an opportunity to celebrate and be recognized as part of these ceremonies.

After you have applied to graduate, it is recommended that you check your graduation eligibility status in UWinsite Student regularly, as applications are being evaluated on an ongoing basis. For instructions on how to monitor your graduation eligibility status, please refer to this ask.UWindsor article. Note: Your graduation eligibility status will be "Approved" or "Conditionally Eligible" if you have been deemed eligible to graduate. Specifically: - "Approved" indicates you are approved to graduate - "Conditionally Eligible" indicates you are conditionally eligible to graduate based on the successful completion of your courses. How will my name appear on my diploma/certificate? How can I change it? Your diploma/certificate parchment will display your full legal name, as show on your primary name in UWinsite Student. To make changes to your official name, you must request the change by emailing the Convocation Coordinator at shari@uwindsor.ca along with a scanned copy of the appropriate supporting documentation (ie. birth certificate, passport). For your correct name to appear on your diploma/certificate and in the Convocation program, it must be received by May 1st for the Spring Convocation and by September 15th for the Fall Convocation. If you send your request after the deadline date, you will have to order and pay for a replacement diploma. Double Major: What Ceremony will you attend? Students who are graduating with a double major will select the ceremony of their first major. Concurrent Education students usually attend the Education ceremony. If you wish to change this, please email the Convocation Coordinator at shari@uwindsor.ca and advise her of your choice. share tweet save Information Booklet - Spring 2020 Convocation POSTPONED share tweet save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
