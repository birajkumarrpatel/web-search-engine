When I ask our students, What does Promise mean to you?, they answer with optimism and hopefulness about fulfilling their potential. All of us have the potential to help others succeed – and in so doing, we enrich both our lives and the lives of those we help. I encourage you to give, and to make the University of Windsor a place of promise: here, now, and in the future. For what is and what, with your help, is about to be.
