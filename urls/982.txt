Given that, we advise you to review the forms below (their purposes and submission guidelines) so that you may be familiar enough with them to use them as needed. If you have any questions, please contact your Advisor or a member of the SAS exam team. Express Registration Form If you are a student who has been registered with SAS for more than one term and would like to waive the right to meet with your SAS Advisor, please complete the Express Registration Form and submit it to sas@uwindsor.ca. The form will then be submitted to your Advisor who will then go ahead and generate your letters of accommodation for the term. If your Advisor needs to meet with you, you will be contacted accordingly. Late Exam Scheduling Appeal Form If you wish to write your final exams at Student Accessibility Services and missed a scheduling deadline, you must complete the late scheduling appeal form. Change of Exam Request Form If you need to write an exam on a day other than when the class is writing, or at a time that is different than that of the class, you will need to download and, together with your Instructor, complete SAS' Change of Exam Request Form. Once complete, you can submit it to SAS' exam team either in person or via e-mail at: exam@uwindsor.ca. share tweet save share tweet save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
