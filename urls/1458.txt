Great bar and staff February 26 Not really worth the money. Location is great, but the hotel itself was a bit outdated on the inside... and our room had stained blankets and towels, which did not impress us (especially my dad since hotel textiles is his line of work). Temperature in the room was also really cold all the time. Hotel of this "class" and price range should have a free breakfast. As said: Okay if you're arriving or departuring O'Hare, but not worth the money. See More June 24, 2017 See All See More
