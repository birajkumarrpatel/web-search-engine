International Development Provost’s Message Provost’s MessageSeptember 1, 2019 Welcome to the Office of the Provost at the University of Windsor. Who we are The University of Windsor is exceptional. Take, for starters, the broad range of programs we offer – Engineering, Law, Nursing, Education, Business, Human Kinetics, Science, and Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences. Then add in our signature programs in Great Lakes research, Visual Arts & the Built Environment, Social Work, Sport Management, Health & Biomedical Sciences, and a dual Law degree in both Canada and the US. Having such a rich mix of programs – professional, applied, experiential, and theoretical – means that our students have far-reaching opportunities in curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular ways. Where we are No other university in Canada can boast a location that is 600 metres away from a foreign country, an international neighbour, and a city with a French name: Detroit. Put a compass in the middle of the iconic Ambassador Bridge, describe a circle, and you have a greater metropolitan area of more than 5 million people in two different countries, with exponential social and cultural opportunities. We are in that part of Canada once known as la nouvelle France, which explains our rich heritage of French place-names. Our campus is situated on the traditional territory of the Three Fires Confederacy of First Nations. We are the fourth most culturally and ethnically diverse city in all of Canada. In short, we welcome the world to Windsor. Where you fit in Whether you are a current or future member of the University of Windsor community – student, faculty, or staff – I invite you to browse these pages for more information about us, or follow the links to learn about our priorities, our successes, and our aspirations. You will find that since 1857 we have been a progressive and inclusive community that comes together to study, to learn, to teach, and to serve. We are a community where we care for one another, where we have our neighbour’s back, and our neighbour has ours. And we are proud of that. Take a virtual tour of our university, or contact us for a campus tour in person, or arrange to sit in on a class. Visit our booth at the Ontario Universities’ Fair in Toronto on September 27-29. And be sure to come to our Fall Open House on Saturday, November 2 to learn more about our programs and to meet awesome students and professors. And when you do, you’ll understand why we are Windsor Proud.
