Transfer Credit Process If you are transferring from another postsecondary institution (whether college or university), you should complete the OUAC 105 online application form. Once you have applied and we have received a copy of your transcript your transfer credit assessment will begin. The University of Windsor will transfer the maximum credit possible. Transfer credit awarded can be affected by your grade point average, residency rules and the relevance of previous coursework to the degree program to which you have applied. You may receive transfer credit based on courses previously evaluated at the U of Windsor. View existing equivalencies on our Course Equivalency Database. You will be asked to submit course outlines for courses that have not been previously evaluated for transfer credit. Once the new transfer credit results are complete, your UWinsite Student account will be updated. It is recommended course outlines be submitted by May 15 to ensure credit evaluation for the Fall semester and November 15 for the Winter semester. Guidelines for Submitting Course Outlines To be considered for transfer credit, a detailed course outline (issued by the previous institution) must be submitted for each course completed at another post-secondary institution and not previously assessed by the University of Windsor. Submit each course outline electronically to your appropriate Admissions Officer making sure to include the following course information: Course code, number and title, year and semester of course Learning outcomes/Course Objectives Course prerequisite(s), if any Weekly list of topics Duration of Study (e.g. 3 hrs/week for 12 weeks) Course Description Textbook(s) used including title, author(s), and edition(s) Methods of evaluation/Grading scheme Lab information (if applicable) Instructor's name and credentials Not accepted are: Hard copies of course outlines Altered copies of outlines Student translation of outlines Handwritten documents Transfer credit assessments from other institutions If outlines are written in a language other than English, a notarized translation must be provided.
