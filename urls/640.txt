Whatever your goals, whatever your plan, we have a program for you. Our flagship Juris Doctor provides our students with a solid foundation in law together with the opportunity to customize their program depending upon their individual interests and goals. Our students learn from, and work with, a faculty of outstanding scholars who are inspiring, engaged and supportive. Windsor Law Admissions staff and Student Ambassadors participate in a number of information fairs at our Windsor campus and at other universities. Our Canadian & American Dual JD Program offered with the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law is the only one of its kind in North America that provides students with the opportunity to earn both a Canadian and a US law degree in three years. Our joint MSW/JD recognizes the increasing synergy between the work performed by social workers and the role being played by justice-minded lawyers. And, our integrated MBA/JD degree, offered in partnership with the Odette School of Business, can be earned in four years instead of five. Students who are admitted to the JD program at the University of Windsor may defer their entry by one year to complete the requirements of an MA degree in Philosophy. Qualifying students must submit a separate application to the MA program in Philosophy at the University of Windsor and satisfy the same admission requirements as regular MA applicants. Two spots are available each year. Applications are processed in the order in which they are received. Students who submit a complete application by May 1st will be considered for entrance scholarships and graduate assistantships. A summer scholarship (awarded by the Faculty of Law) is also available. For more information, interested students should contact the Graduate Coordinator for Philosophy. How to Apply Complete the online Ontario Law School Application. Take note of the application deadlines and admissions criteria for your particular program. For lawyers seeking to further specialize, we offer a robust research-based LLM program that can be pursued in almost any area of law. Those with law degrees who are interested in pursuing a career in research and teaching can take advantage of our innovative LLM with Certificate in University Teaching and Learning, which provides students with an opportunity to earn a University Teaching Certificate and complete a practicum at the Faculty of Law.
