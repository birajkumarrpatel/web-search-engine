As a result, the priorities, plans and budgets of many of our operating funded organizations must shift in response. OAC has therefore suspended all upcoming operating program deadlines and assessments while we prioritize processing payments to operating grant recipients as soon as we are able. We recognize the urgent need for organizations to access their operating funds under current circumstances and we are working to address that. https://www.arts.on.ca/…/2020/covid-19-update-for-march-27,… Ontario Arts Council - Conseil des arts de l'Ontario 7 hrs · "The arts provide the reassurance of narrative, the peace of contemplation and, most of all, the power of community, experiences that can be hard to define but which the current crisis is laying bare," via The Globe and Mail. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/…/article-why-we-need-the-…/ The arts provide the reassurance of narrative, the peace of contemplation and, most of all, the power of community theglobeandmail.com Why we need the arts, now more than ever The arts provide the reassurance of narrative, the peace of contemplation and, most of all, the power of community The arts provide the reassurance of narrative, the peace of contemplation and, most of all, the power of community See All See More
