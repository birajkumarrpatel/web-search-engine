You will need an advisor and will conduct research under your advisor’s supervision. This program is designed to be completed in two years. Scholarships and graduate assistantships are available by application. Continuation of your education is possible with this degree. A major paper option is also available. You will take eight courses and will conduct less advanced research resulting in a Major Paper over approximately two years. MEng An MEng Degree may be awarded upon successful completion of a total of eight courses (the MEng has no research component/thesis/work with a faculty supervisor). Of these eight courses: Five courses must be from the student's department (major; environmental) Plus three required courses: Engineering Technical Communications, Engineering Mathematics and Engineering Project Management (to be taken in the first or second semester of the program) Co-op program is optional and students must apply for admission in their first study term. No funding or scholarships are available. Please also review the MEng website for a note regarding admissions PhD An applicant for admission to graduate studies leading to the PhD degree in Environmental engineering must normally be a graduate of a recognized university with a master's degree in applied science (MASc) or the equivalent. Applicants with degrees in related fields will be considered but will normally require strengthening of their background in Environmental engineering. Our objective is to attract the best students and to educate them in the rigors of scientific research. We provide a scholarly and dynamic environment with attention to scientific discipline, detail and accuracy. Areas of Specialization Geotechnical: Major equipment is available to measure triaxial compression, direct shear, unconfined compression, compaction and bearing ratio on soils and subgrades. A cold room with a computer data acquisition system for measuring the load/deformation characteristics of soil-structure interactions is used for cold region engineering. Hydraulics: Two hydraulic laboratories are equipped with three flumes for analysis of unidirectional flow, including one tilting flume, one wave flume and one scour basin. Equipment is available for detailed measurements of flow velocity and turbulence, water, surface and bed surface profiling. Structures: State-of-the-art equipment facilities are available in the Structures Laboratory to meet the research needs of graduate and undergraduate students. A one-dimensional shaking table, a computer-controlled fatigue-testing machine, and a high-capacity reaction floor for large-scale structural tests are among the key facilities used by graduate students. The research group in structures also maintains high-end computers and a range of finite-element analysis packages for student training. Transportation: The Transportation Systems Innovation (TSI) laboratory provides opportunities for training and higher education in transportation. The TSI lab features eight professional LCD TVs to display and analyze traffic in real-timefrom traffic cameras. The lab also has high-end computerfacilities, including a server, desktops and workstations, a large-format scanner and a printer. The lab also houses a partial-cab research driving simulator to observe driver behaviour under various driving and traffic conditions. Environmental: Our environmental engineering laboratories are equipped with state-of-the-art instruments which are capable of analyzing physical, chemical and biological contaminants in any matrix, including water, wastewater, air and soil. Undergraduate and graduate research laboratories boast state-of-the-art equipment.
