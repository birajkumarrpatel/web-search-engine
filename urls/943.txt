The program provides graduate students with a critical and theoretical framework that enables the independent development of artistic research and studio production that is supported by a range of dynamic faculty, visiting artists, curators and critics. Windsor’s School of Creative Arts has one of the longest running MFA programs in Canada, founded in 1979. University of Windsor MFA graduates have gone on to establish significant careers as visual artists, educators, curators and arts professionals. Our program is distinguished for its focus on intensive graduate supervision, spacious facilities and openness to unconventional practices. We encourage a multi-disciplinary approach to art that enables students to experiment with a variety of media and methods to discover those best suited to realizing their creative projects. Recently these have ranged from video installation, audio responsive installation, performance, social practice, bio art, and urban interventions. MFA Film and Media Arts The School of Creative Arts also offers an MFA in Film and Media Arts program. Like the MFA in Visual Arts, the MFA in Film and Media Arts focuses on studio production with an emphasis on multidisciplinary collaboration. Students are expected to create films and multimedia works in a variety of genres en route to developing a thesis project. Our faculty have established national and international reputations, exhibiting, performing, and screening films regularly in Canada and abroad. Currently, School of Creative Arts faculty members are working on a range of externally funded projects that explore multimedia performance, the intersection of art and biotechnology, ecology, architecture, documentary film, and urban culture. We encourage applications from artists working in a wide variety of contemporary practices. share tweet save Notices EMPLOYMENT GA Positions for Winter 2020 are now closed.
