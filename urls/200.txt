A single person can be the tipping point for the development of a life-saving medicine, the composition of an inspiring symphony, or the removal of barriers to justice. When a university education is accessible to all, everyone benefits. Students gain deeper perspectives when different viewpoints and traditions are shared and lived. This University is a place where students of every background and income level can come together to create their own opportunities, and achieve their promise.
