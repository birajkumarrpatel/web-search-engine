The teaching is incredible with amazing engineering facilities and superior support from faculty members. For a final year project or a simple question in the class, a faculty member will always help. The campus is so vibrant that I never feel like I’m away from home. Aditya Vyas Vadodara, India The International Students Centre (ISC) helped ease the transition when coming to the University of Windsor. The ISC often hosts events for international students to get acquainted, share their experiences and learn about Canadian culture. Staying in residence was also helpful with the transition to Canada. I was able to connect with other students and get familiar with the campus. I even worked for residence services. This enhanced my communication skills and allowed me to gain some valuable work experience. Chelsea Okonji Lagos, Nigeria In my Human Kinetics program, I have found integrated research and volunteer opportunities. I’ve also been able to connect with other students through intramural basketball. Eric Chen Beijing, China I have taken advantage of the services available at the Student Success Centre by booking monthly appointments with my Academic Advisors. These appointments allowed me to speak about my schedule, courses, and time management strategy. Having someone to follow up with my progress was helpful because I improved my skills through the resources provided. This is one of the many UWindsor services that helped me enhance in my academic experience.
