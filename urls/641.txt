Our three-year JD program provides the theoretical framework and experiential learning opportunities to effectively and successfully practise law in Canada. Students leverage their classroom knowledge to help real clients at Windsor Law's two poverty law clinics and the first university-based mediation service in Canada. The joint Canadian & American Dual JD Program prepares students to bridge the distinct legal cultures of Canada and the United States. The three-year integrated program, a collaboration between Windsor Law and the University Of Detroit Mercy School Of Law, is the first of its kind in North America. At Windsor Law, we encourage our students to think beyond traditional legal careers. That is why we have joined forces with other University of Windsor faculties to offer joint MBA/JD and MSW/JD degrees. Earn combined Business or Social Work and Law degrees in four years instead of five and acquire the essential legal tools to succeed in a broad range of careers. For lawyers seeking to further specialize, we offer a robust research-based LLM program that can be pursued in almost any area of law. Students may choose from two streams: a one-year (12 month) regular LLM or a two-year (24 month) LLM with Certificate in University Teaching and Learning. Our innovative LLM with Certificate in University Teaching and Learning provides students with an opportunity to earn a University Teaching Certificate and complete a practicum at the Faculty of Law.
