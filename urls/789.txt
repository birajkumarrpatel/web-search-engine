The mandate of the ACC is to ensure that all research with animals is conducted in accordance with the highest ethical and humane standards and that the animals, the public, the researchers, and the University of Windsor are all protected from harm. All ACC policies and procedures are designed to comply with those of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC). All personnel who will be involved in the use of animals in research (as indicated on the AUPP form) must demonstrate an understanding of the principles and theory required for vertebrate animal-based studies. Toward this objective the ACC has developed an On-Line Theory Course composed of 14 modules to meet the requirements of the ACC and CCAC before beginning work with vertebrate animals. Individuals needing to take this training course should read the Introductory Module (see listings to the left on the home page) to determine the modules to be read to receive a Certificate of Good Animal Practice before proceeding work with animals. The Online Course is available 24/7 for the convenience of everyone.
