Please note that the RDC is still accepting applications, however, there will likely be longer delays than usual. Our Western RDC analysts will be working from home and can address any questions you have: Tina Luu Ly tluuly@uwo.ca and Victoria Gaudin vgaudin@uwo.ca This is obviously inconvenient for all of us, but it might also be worth condiering the following alternatives: 1. Moving to different projects, if possible. 2. Conducting your project with public-use microdata files or data from other countries. The Academic Data Centre (ADC) can assist remotely during this time to help with accessing public use microdata and other public sources. Email: libdata@uwindsor.ca . Official Statistics Canada office on campus The Statistics Canada Research Data Centre, located on the first floor of the Leddy Library, is a combination of a high-security Statistics Canada office on the University of Windsor campus and a statistical analysis computing laboratory. It is a branch of the Western Research Data Centre. Major research projects Faculty and Graduate level students are allowed access to detailed data for pure and applied research after approval of an NSERC/SSHRC application that has been peer reviewed through a process managed jointly by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council and Statistics Canada. Stats Canada description of the review process. A streamlined application process (.pdf) is available for Graduate level courses that use the services of the Research Data Centre to help students gain experience in complex data analysis. Over 100 detailed microdata sets available Social Science health and policy researchers now have local access to over 100 confidential microdata sets (unavailable to the public) from Statistics Canada's population and household surveys, including a number of major longitudinal surveys that track the responses of individuals over a period of time and offer a richer source for analyzing social issues than do the traditional, more limited, cross-sectional surveys.
