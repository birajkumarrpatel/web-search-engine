Outreach program offers high schoolers week-long experience as UWindsor science students Jul 18th, 2019 The UWindsor Science Academy welcomed local secondary school students to campus July 8 to 12 for the chance to explore the science programs offered at the University of Windsor. Science-driven high schoolers, nominated by their teachers or schools to attend the free week-long program, participated in lectures, hands-on laboratory exercises, and research lab tours. Luca Pullo from St. Anne’s Catholic High School was one of dozens of local high schoolers nominated this summer to attend. “I’ve always had a strong interest in the sciences,” says Pullo. “For that reason, I expressed my interest in attending, and I feel very lucky that my teacher felt I was a strong student and nominated me for this opportunity.” Dora Cavallo-Medved, professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences, runs the Science Academy and says the program helps prepare students for successful careers in science. “We had a fantastic week,” says Dr. Cavallo-Medved. “We had 50 of our top local high school science students from 17 different schools exploring our research labs and experiencing the many engaging opportunities we offer our students. They all really appreciated the opportunity to experience life as a UWindsor Science student and catch a glimpse into their futures.” Pullo says the experience was both engaging and informative. “I was given a good idea of the programs available in the Faculty of Science,” says Pullo. “And it was also great to be able to see exactly what I would be doing in each program.” On the final day of the Science Academy, each participant received a certificate of completion. Kyla Hicks and Anumita Jain were awarded bursaries from the Friends of Ojibway Prairie to attend the Ontario Nature Youth Summit this September. “It was wonderful seeing the students so excited to win,” says Mike Fisher, manager of web services and systems support, who sits on the organization’s board of directors. “We are thankful to everyone involved with Science Academy for making it such a great week for the students, and for helping the Friends of Ojibway Prairie become a part of their experience as well.” —Darko Milenkovic Dora Cavallo-Medved Mike Fisher Jeff Berryman Strategic Priority: Engage in community partnerships Academic Area: Science share tweet save IT Services Office 365 Group and OneDrive Access Issue Mar 31, 2020 Project Notifications CAW Student Centre - Marketplace Dining Hall Renovations - Access Disrupted, April 6 - September 1, 2020, 7:00am-11:00pm Chrysler Hall Tower/North/South-Building Locked Until Further Notice, March 25, 2020, 11:00am Biology Building-326A & 326B Upgrades Project-SU #1 Air Handling System for Addition Only, March 25,2020, 8:00am-12:00pm Lambton Tower-Heat Pumps Installations/HVAC Shutdown, March 24-25, 2020, 8:00am-2:00pm Essex Hall-Removal of Wind Tunnel (Room 303), March 23-27, 2020, 7:00am-4:00pm More share tweet save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
