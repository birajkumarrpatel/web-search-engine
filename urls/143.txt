Entertainment Expenses are not to be charged to the University unless they are incurred in the bona fide entertainment of University visitors. Luncheons, breakfasts, dinners, parties, receptions, etc., primarily for your own faculty or staff members, are not proper charges against University funds. Gifts, memorials and donations are personal expenses and are not to be charged against University funds. The Human Resources Department sends flowers on the occasion of a death in the immediate family of any staff member, thus other floral tributes by individual Faculties, Schools, or Departments must be paid for by the donors. Any further questions regarding non-allowable expenses should be directed to the Finance Department. Direct Deposit (EFT) Payment All Canadian vendors requesting payments in Canadian funds must submit the Direct Deposit form to eft@uwindsor.ca . These payments are automatically and securely deposited into a designated bank account, with an automated e-mail remittance advice sent to the specified e-mail account as confirmation of payment being deposited. All University of Windsor employees requesting reimbursements in Canadian funds must update their banking information in UWinsite Finance.
