In Spring 2017, they responded in unprecedented numbers, owing to the joint efforts of faculty, staff, and the students themselves. Dean Khan and Department Head, Dave Andrews were very pleased with the results from Kinesiology. Faculty members, staff and students are committed to fostering a great learning environment and #HKFamily atmosphere - which was recognized by both first year and senior year students in the results.
