Meal Plan holders will be entitled to a prorated credit on their closing meal plan balance on April 21, 2020. We are anticipating the credit will be applied to your flex account by May 15th. For students returning to residence for the Fall 2020 semester, your meal plan credit can be applied to the cost of your Fall 2020 meal plan instalment. For those students not returning to the University for the Fall 2020 semester, we ask that you contact the UwinCARD Office after May 15th to discuss our refund policy.
